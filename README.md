Hello, world!

I'm here today working on this exercise.  It was left to the reader to do. 

So they say to do an "about me."  So about me is that I like to program.  Mainly doing it in C++ and Java, but onetime I was dabbling in Objective-C during the delicious era.  I wish that stayed around, but now it's onto Swift.

Anyhow, that's me...
